All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [7.0.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- Add Fedora KDE 44 / Plasma 6.6 as the primary development, CI, demo, validation, and release target.
- Add `just fedora44-check` with actionable checks for Fedora version, Plasma tools, Qt6/KF6 dependencies, KWallet/libsecret, QML import paths, install shadowing, AppStream, rpmlint, source packaging, plasmoid packaging, and payload validation.
- Add Provider Catalog v2 static metadata plus `scripts/check_provider_catalog.py` to keep provider/model/pricing metadata maintainable without runtime scraping.
- Expand Diagnostics into a Trust Center for actual API usage, estimated cost, rate-limit-only data, local filesystem-derived data, Browser Sync Labs, catalog freshness, KWallet status, and provider health.
- Add Simple / Operator / Analyst popup modes, show-only-problems filtering, direct empty-state actions, adaptive refresh scheduling, and visible refresh/failure/database diagnostics.

### Changed
- Move CI to `fedora:44` and validate source/plasmoid package checks in CI.
- Generalize Fedora KDE demo setup to `scripts/demo/setup_fedora_kde_test_env.sh --fedora 44`.
- Update Copilot tracking language and configuration for premium requests, usage-based billing, credits mode, and configurable monthly reset assumptions.
- Improve Browser Sync Labs readiness for Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Brave, KWallet/libsecret safe storage, cookie DB readability, and safe local-estimation fallback messaging.
- Keep v7.0.0 explicitly Plasma-native and local-first; backend services, web dashboards, PostgreSQL, and multi-user features remain out of scope.

## [6.0.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- Fixed version drift across the repository (updated to 6.0.1).
- Ensured `plugin/CMakeLists.txt` is consistent with `qmlRegisterType` calls in `plugin/aiusageplugin.cpp`.
- Updated documentation and roadmap to reflect 6.0.1 stabilization release.

## [6.0.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **First-Run Guided Setup:** A simplified onboarding flow for new users, offering a "Recommended" path to quickly connect top providers.
- **Basic / Advanced Settings Mode:** Hides complex configurations (like custom base URLs, tier selection, deployments) behind an Advanced Mode toggle to reduce visual clutter for everyday users.
- **Data Trust & Confidence Labeling:** Provider cards now clearly indicate the type of data being displayed (Actual, Estimated, Rate-limit only, Local, Subscription-plan derived) and health status (Healthy, Degraded, Disconnected).
- **Diagnostics Center:** A dedicated config tab showing KWallet health, Browser Sync readiness, installed CLI tools, and quick access to run the deep system doctor script.
- **Config Portability:** Export and import non-secret configurations to share presets or backup UI settings safely.
- **Configuration Presets:** Quick one-click setups for common scenarios: Solo Developer, Multi-Provider, Local-First, Budget Watch, and Loofi Operator.
- **Compact Panel Upgrades:** Pin new key metrics directly in the compact Plasma panel view: Daily Cost, Remaining Requests, or Most Critical Provider.
- **Analyst & History Redesign:** Refined history controls, updated compare mode to look like a first-class view, and improved ranking panels in TrendSummary.
- **Config Screen Polish:** Updated all configuration screens to follow the new v6 visual language with improved spacing, grouping, and context hints.

### Changed
- **Dashboard Actionability:** Replaced static dashboard summaries with actionable insights: Top Risk, Budget Left Today, and Next Reset.
- **Browser Sync to Labs:** Explicitly marked Browser Sync as an experimental Labs feature to set correct reliability expectations.

## [5.4.1] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed

## [3.8.1] — 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Add actionable error hints in ProviderCard — maps common HTTP errors (401, 403, 429), network failures, and KWallet errors to plain-language fix instructions
- Add stale user-local version detection in `install_bootstrap.sh` — warns when a cached `~/.local` copy shadows a freshly installed system package

### Changed

- `install.sh` now uses `--method auto` instead of `--method source`, so Fedora users are routed through COPR (faster, no compiler needed) by default
- `install_bootstrap.sh` now offers to reload plasmashell immediately after any install method completes, so the widget appears without a manual restart
- `install_local_plasmoid.sh` now uses `--install` for first-time installs and `--upgrade` for subsequent updates, fixing a failure when no prior user-local copy existed
